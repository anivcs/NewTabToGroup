# New Tab To Group
Created a chrome extension that provides a keyboard shortcut to add a tab into a tab group.
The shortcut is: **Control + Shift + L (on Windows) and CMD + Shift + L (Mac)**.
You can change the shortcut by changing `manifest.json` and loading the changes using the extension developer mode.
